cure of conspitation and soiling

# symptom
- soil at least twice a week for last 3 years
- has less than 3 BMs a week
- sometimes has rabbit stool  (type 1 in [[#Bristol stool chart]]) a few times a day
- passage of large stool which block the toilet every 3~4 days, much less or no soiling the next day when it happens
- evidents of "stool holding" posture

# diagnosis
After going through "Key components of history-taking to diagnose constipation" in ![[Constipation in children and young people: diagnosis and management.pdf#page=10]], I suspect it is a chronic constipation cause by failed toilet training.

# solution
The solution is based on this [flowchart](https://eric.org.uk/childrens-continence-pathway/flowchart-constipation/)
1. Disimpaction 
	Follow these references: ![[A-Parents-Guide-to-Disimpaction.pdf]] and ![[howtousemacrogollaxativesmay2022.pdf]].
	 A sachet in Movicol Junior contains 
		Marcrogol 3350 6.563g
		Sodium chloride 175.4mg
		Sodium bicarbonate 89.3mg
		Postassium chloride 23.3mg
		so we start with 4*6.563=26.2g
	
2. Maintenance
start with dose when reaching disimpaction.

##### Bristol stool chart
![[Bristol_stool_chart.jpg]]
Different sources give slightly different opinions on what is normal  stool. [This source](https://www.gutsense.org/constipation/normal_stools.html) considers type 4 and type 5 are normal, while [this one](https://pediatricsurgery.stanford.edu/Conditions/BowelManagement/bristol-stool-form-scale.html) suggests that type 3 and 4 are ideal, and [this](https://eric.org.uk/poo-checker/) indicates that only type 3 is ideal, while type 5,6 maybe ok.
